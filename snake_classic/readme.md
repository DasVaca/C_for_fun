## Snake classic
You all already know the game, here's an implementation with C using ncurses.

## Usage
```sh
make snake
```
This will create a bunch of object files, you could skipped and compile all together (like *.c *.h), that's not funny though.

Finally in order to play just run
```sh
./snake <initial-length> <initial-level>
```
A file called log.txt will be created, it does what the name suggest.
> arguments are optional

## Todo
- Welcome and Game Over windows
- Colors / Making it more funny
